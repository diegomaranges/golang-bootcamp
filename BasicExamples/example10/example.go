/*### Exercise
Before moving along with the rest of the contents head over to the [loops and functions exercise](https://tour.golang.org/flowcontrol/8) and implement what it is requested there. Try to run your code locally so that you check that the environment you setup previously is properly working.*/

package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func Sqrt(x float64) float64 {
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(Sqrt(2))
}
